AllJoyn Version 2.4.0 Beta Metro Release Notes
----------------------------------------------

Platform Support
----------------

1) Windows 8 (64 bit)


Features added in this release
------------------------------

1) Beta support for Windows 8 / Metro applications


Known issues and limitations with this release
----------------------------------------------

Our objects use strong reference counting and do not require calling .Dispose()
in C# or the equivalent (delete) in C++; in fact, this will throw() if attempted.

If you wish to self-host applications, please note two Metro apps are not
allowed to comminucate on the same machine; this means you will need to have two
Windows 8 machines in order to test your application.

The RSA provider is broken; don't use it.
