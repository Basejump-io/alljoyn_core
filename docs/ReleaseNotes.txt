Features added in this release
------------------------------

1) The Android  bus-daemon-user and bus-daemon-service samples were 
   replaced with a new "Java launchable daemon" called Alljoyn.apk.
   This new APK can be used to install and run the AllJoyn daemon on
   non-rooted Android devices. Note that the Java launchable daemon
   of the daemon does not support peer connections over bluetooth.

2) AllJoyn operation inside the Android emulator envirnonment is now
   supported.

3) Added an asynchronous version of BusAttachment::JoinSession.

4) Minor modifications to the security API to allow for shared keystores.


Issues Addressed in this Release
--------------------------------

1) Several Bluetooth related stability issues were addressed in this
   release.

2) ALLJOYN-341: The Java launchable (wifi-only) daemon for Android was
   unstable in version 2.0.1. This sample has been updated and renamed
   to Alljoyn.apk.

3) ALLJOYN-494: AllJoyn java binding calls that return QStatus can return
   null instead of a valid QStatus in certain error situations.

4) ALLJOYN-519: A ProxyBusObject may trigger a segmentation fault if it is
   deleted while threads are blocked inside ProxyBusObjec::MethodCall().

5) ALLJOYN-544: Java binding is now thread safe.


Known issues and limitations with this release
----------------------------------------------

1) ALLJOYN-557: Signals can be delivered twice when eavsdropping mode is
   enabled in the AllJoyn daemon.

2) ALLJOYN-580: AllJoyn currently has separate versions for Froyo and
   Gingerbread due to dependencies on libcrypto.

3) ALLJOYN-584: An AllJoyn client and service on the same device cannot
   share the same keystore.

4) ALLJOYN-593: test/sessions sample does not handle LostAdvertisedName.


Compatibility
-------------
Applications written for AllJoyn 1.X will need to be modified and rebuilt
for use with AllJoyn 2.0 and later.

The AllJoyn wire protocol related to encryption and authentication has changed
in the 2.1.0 release. AllJoyn interfaces that use security will not interoperate
with devices whose AllJoyn version is less than 2.1.0.

The AllJoyn wire protocol was modified to have a 128kB maximum message size
starting with version 2.1.0. Earlier versions of AllJoyn which attempt to
send messages that are greater than 128kB will not interoperate with versions
greater than or equal to 2.1.0.
