Submitting contributions to the AllJoynâ„¢ Open Source Project

How to create a patch for the Alljoyn source and submit it to alljoyn.org
=========================================================================

Below are instructions on how to generate a patch containing your software
changes, and submit it to alljoyn.org via e-mail. If you are downloading the
AllJoyn source for the first time, please see [the project homepage][1].

Ground rules for submitting AllJoyn patches
-------------------------------------------
  1. Register your name and e-mail address with alljoyn.org
    * Send the patch from the same e-mail address you used to register when
clicking through the [contribution agreement][2] (CLA).
    * Review the [contribution guidelines][3]
    * Enter your registered name and e-mail address into repo and git. The
"author" (name and e-mail address) in your git patches must match your
registered name and address, i.e. the 'user.email' variable must contain the
same email as the one used for the [CLA][2].

  2. One e-mail message must contain one AllJoyn patch
    * Each AllJoyn patch must be transmitted as a single e-mail message.
Multiple git patches can be bundled into a single e-mail message and submitted
as a single AllJoyn patch.
    * Each AllJoyn patch should be self-contained. For example, if you have
two separate patches that depend on each other to work, please make sure to
bundle and submit as a single patch. If sent separately, you will run the risk
of both patches being rejected - even if you sent both e-mails at the same
time.
    * Alljoyn.org cannot accept e-mail attachments. Git patches must be be
sent as plain text in the body of the e-mail.

  3. One git project at a time
    * Each AllJoyn patch can affect only one AllJoyn git project. For example,
you may not include git patches for both alljoyn_core and alljoyn_java in the
same patch e-mail.

  4. Save that workspace!
    * E-mails can get lost; a patch may need to be reworked and re-submitted.
Whenever you submit an AllJoyn patch, please save the working directory it
came from and start a new working directory if needed.

Create the AllJoyn patch and e-mail to alljoyn.org
--------------------------------------------------
**Note**: You must send the email from the same e-mail address you registered
when signing the [CLA][2].

>
>         cd <alljoyn project>
>         git format-patch --stdout github/master > patch.file

The following information needs to be added before the patch files in the body
of the email. The easiest way to do this is to edit the patch file before
mailing it.

  1. PROJECT= the git project the patch applies to (alljoyn_core, for
example).
  2. BRANCH= the **git branch** the patch applies to (for example, B01.08).
This is an optional field, it can be omitted if the patch is for master.
  3. TITLE= a one-line title for the patch.
  4. DESCRIPTION= a brief, multi-line description of what the patch is for, if
it is related to other patches, and so on. Everything following the '=' until
the separator described next is considered to be part of the description. i.e.
do not include any of the items listed above after this one as they will not
get handled correclty.
  5. A line consisting of three or more '---' characters.

An example edited patch file might look like the following:

>
>       PROJECT=alljoyn_java
>       BRANCH=master
>       TITLE=Support AllJoyn discovery on XYZ
>       DESCRIPTION=This patch fixes multiple problems
>       with the AllJoyn discovery protocol on XYZ devices.
>       ---

You can either edit the patch file and e-mail it directly...

         mail < patch.file submissions@alljoyn.org

...or, use your favorite e-mail client:

  * set the message format to "plain text"
  * copy the entire edited patch file into your e-mail editor
  * hit send!

**Note:** Make sure that your mail client doesn't insert any hard line wraps
as that will break the patch.
